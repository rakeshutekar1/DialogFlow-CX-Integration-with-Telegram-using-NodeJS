After creating the key download it in JSON file.

Now to run the code you have to run the following command in your terminal or CMD to connect with your dailogflow:

$env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="C:\Users\user\location\nameofyourfile.json"

(*remember*you have to run this everytime you run the code after closing it)


and simply run the nodemon dialogindex.js and test your bot on telegram.

Enjoy.
